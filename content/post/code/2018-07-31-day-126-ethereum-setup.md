# Progress

* Set up Solidity compiler to build contracts. Previously was using Remix online tool.
* Created basic boilerplate for code I entered in [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/)
* Took code from Remix and wrote it locally, in preparation for compiling and deploying on my own.

Folder structure

```
contracts/  
├-- Inbox.sol
  
test/
├-- Inbox.test.js

package.js
oncompile.js
deploy.js  
```

# Thoughts

Glad I got some experience with the mysterious blockchain. I'm getting an idea of how this thing works. Looking forward to participating in it!
