# Day 103

## Today's Progress

* Wrote a couple more tests 
* Added more page utilities for UI actions
* Read about Matchers

<!--more-->

## Thoughts

Read a lot about Matchers. There are no IDs on the UI components, so I'm describing them in relation to each other. This works for most cases, but is tedious and sometimes ambiguous.
