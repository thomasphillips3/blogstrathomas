# Day 112

## Today's Progress

Started reading the [React-Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

## Thoughts

I've been writing Espresso tests for React-Native apps, but am not familiar with the framework itself. I don't know much about React at all, so this will be an enlightening experience.
