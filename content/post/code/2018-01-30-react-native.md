# Day 113

## Today's Progress

Continuing on yesterday's intro to React-Native, I watched a [crash course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkualZPRZCs&t=2494s).

## Thoughts

It's pretty straightforward since I have a pretty good understanding of Javascript, CSS, and HTML. I'm going to do some more involved projects this week too.
