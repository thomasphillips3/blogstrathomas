# Day 117

## Today's Progress

Set up an Arduino C project with a DHT11 sensor using PlatformIO in Atom. 

## Thoughts

I've been wanting to set up a real C dev environment for a while now. Arduino is cool for learning, but I wanted a more full-featured IDE for my tinkering. 

I read all about the DHT11 - how it works, how to wire it, and how to code with it.
