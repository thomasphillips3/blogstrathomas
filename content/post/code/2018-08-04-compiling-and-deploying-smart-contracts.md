# Progress

* Wrote code to compile smart contract written in Solidity
* Deployed to RInkeby test network using [Infura API](https://infura.io)

# Thoughts

This first project in [Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/overview) was a simple smart contract that deployed with an initial message which could be updated. It was a simple project that gave me an intro to 

* Solidity language
* Compiling smart contracts
* Deploying smart contracts
* Interacting with deployed smart contracts

Very solid intro and I can't wait to continue to the next section.
