# Today's Progress

* [2D Array](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/2d-array)

# Thoughts

Took me a while to get this one. It was way simpler than I thought. Found a similar [answer on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37363674/java-how-to-solve-this-2d-array-hour-glass) for some inspiration. I actually made the same mistake as the person who asked. I had a condition looking for non-zero entries. This was causing me to miss any hourglasses that start with 0.
