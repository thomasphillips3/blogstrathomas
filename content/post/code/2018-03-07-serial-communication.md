# Day 119

## Today's Progress

* Read [Serial Communication](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication)

## Thoughts

I really want to understand Bluetooth communication, so I bought a [Nordic nRF52832](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF52832). I realized that in order to program it, I needed a [5V FTDI Basic breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716).
