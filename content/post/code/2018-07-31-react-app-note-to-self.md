# Day 125: React app: Note to Self

## Progress

![null](/img/notetoself.gif)

Created a web app that allows users to

* to type a list of things
* long press to delete
* saved data in a cookie

## Thoughts

> _If you want to keep building upon NoteToSelf and extend your React skills, perhaps you would like to challenge yourself by adding these features:_
>
> * **_A way to delete individual notes (done âœ“)_**
> * _A way to edit individual notes._
> * _A way to re-order notes._
> * _Add local storage with cookies to any feature above._

I really wanted to do more of the extra stuff. It was difficult (but fun) to figure out [how to implement a long press in React](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48048957/react-long-press-event). Gonna move on to the next section before I get to implement the edit functionality.
