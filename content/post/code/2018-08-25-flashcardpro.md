# Progress
Finished FlashcardPro app in [React Testing](https://www.udemy.com/react-testing) class


# Thoughts
Got a little more comfortable with Redux. 
> - Redux is a state manager that helps organize the flow of data in our React applications in a predictable way.
> 
> - The Redux Store is one giant object that can represent all of the backing data for a React application.
> 
> - Actions are objects full of information that pass data around the redux application.
> 
> - Action creators construct action objects.
> 
> - Reducers respond to actions and provide ways to update the store.
> 
> - React-Router uses components like the BrowserRouter, Switch, and Route to set up endpoints on the application that link to specific components.

I implemented localstorage as one of the extras in the course work.
