I haven't been keeping track of the days, but I finished [The Complete React Native and Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/) on Udemy today. 

# Thoughts

I really enjoyed this course. The instructor was dope, and I learned a lot. I'm going to take a Jest class next.
