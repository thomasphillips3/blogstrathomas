# Progress
- Read the first 2 Chapters (Foreword & Introduction) of [Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/)
- Read half of Chapter 3 on Collections

# Thoughts
I haven't actually STUDIED a language since the first coding class I took. Most things I do now are geared towards creating specific projects, and don't really go in-depth about the languages themselves. I need this. Excited about this book.
