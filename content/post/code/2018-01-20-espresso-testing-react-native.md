# Day 106

## Today's Progress

More UI tests. 

## Thoughts

Tests are kinda flaky now due to the **`wait`** statements. Read about Espresso Idling Resources and got a good understanding of how that works. Espresso normally waits for all asynchronous tasks to finish before running (**`AsyncTasks`**, **`KeyEvents`**, and **`MotionEvents`**). Some UI elements that I'm testing don't fall into those categories, so using an **`IdlingResource`** catches those. 

> An **`IdlingResource`** is an object created by the test author which contains logical condition that must be additionally met in order for app to achieve idle state.
