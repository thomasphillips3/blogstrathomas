# Day 115

## Today's Progress

Created the basic UI of the app. 

## Thoughts

I had trouble linking to the [**Press Start 2P Font**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P). I found [this on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47733243/270847), which told me to add an **`@import`** statement to the top of my **`App.css`** file. 
```
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Press+Start+2P");
```
